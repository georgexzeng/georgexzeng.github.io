	<title>Comparison of favorite websites</title>

My three favorite sites in the world are Hacker News, Farnam Street Blog, Reddit, and Techmeme.  However, they're not the most interesting sites to compare from a user interface perspective, so I'll review Hackew News, Reddit and Farnam Street Blog
<ol>
<li>Hacker News</li>
<li>Farnam Street Blog</li>
<li>Spotify</li>
</ol>

<p>Hacker news is one of my favorite sites because it helps me see into the future.  Hacker news is a news amalgamation site at is simplest and most powerful.  Its layout is just a list of articles, arranged by voting points, and comments.  There's a simple bar at the top with options for news, comments, ask, jobs and submit.  In one sense of this word, this is horrible user design.  This a dead simple website.  In another sense of the word though, this is an application of the Dieter Rams school of design - that less is more, that design should give way to functionality.  Hacker news feels simple by design, uncaring about its look, with an absolute focus of letting design melt away so the user focuses on the content.  I like this school of design.  </p>

<p>Farnam Street blog is another one of my favorite sites (I noticed I like my favorite sites based on content instead of design) - it helps me learn the best of the past.  Its layout is that of a standard wordpress blog - latest posts arranged in a blog style by date and with options for updates and newsletters.  The site feels standard - not the custom standard of a Hacker News, but a templated form of sterility created by a non-technical person.  Very functional but mothing to write home about.  </p>

<p>Lastly, I decided to choose a site with more pizzaz - Spotify's homepage.  This is the kind of site that's considered "great user design" for consumers.  It's got an engaging landing page with video or pictures of interesting, good looking people.  It's got the typical bootstrap picture frames.  It just looks GREAT.  The Spotify page evokes feelings; it feels sexy, nostalgic, warm, whimsical and like friendship.  It evokes the feelings that music brings.  In the context of what they are (consumer music company; cool cachet; pleasant browsing experience) - it's perfect.  In some ways though, this is easier than the simplicity of a Google webpage or the Apple page of the past.  Going from simple to complex is an evolution; but the ultimate evolution is going from the next phase of complexity to the next phase of simplicity.
