<i>To accomplish unusual results, you have to either do unusual things or the usual things in an unusual way.  Doing the usual things the usual way will just get you the usual results.</i>

•	There are three main levels of hacking school, from hacking a degree (largest macro level); we can go from there to hacking a semester (one level lower) and then hacking an individual class (lowest level).  

Hacking a degree.  
•	Like all levels, hacking a degree requires understanding the requirements for obtaining a degree.  I’ll take Wharton MBA as an example since I go to school here. 
•	Wharton MBA requires you to take a minimum of 19 credits to graduate.  You can take 4 credits as independent studies (which are hackable to maximize learning/relationship building and minimize work).   You can also take 4 credits worth of pass fail classes (which also maximizes learning/relationship building with minimum work).  You can also take GIP (global immersion programs and winter programs that are two week or break trips) offering 0.5-1.0 units of credit.  You can also take up to four classes outside of Wharton during your MBA, which do not count for your grade.  Other constraints like mandatory core classes and majors for graduation exist; but core classes are waiveable (I waived 4-5) and major classes can be taken as independent study or as GIPs.  
•	In this extreme theoretical example, with 4 ISPs, 4 pass/fail; 4 non-Wharton classes and 1 credit worth of GIP, you have 13 credits accounted for and only have to take 6 credits of graded work over four semesters.  That’s 1.5 credit of graded work/semester.  Aceing these classes should be a piece of cake (high GPA should be easily obtainable), which will open up your time to really focus on learning real knowledge (either in the classroom or practical knowledge like working at a company) and on building real relationships (this is long term most important asset to have – non-specialized knowledge tends to be a commodity but real strong relationships rarely are).  
•	As a heads up, the example above is an extreme edge case.  But understanding the edge cases allow us to understand the outer bounds of possibility and easily tailor our less extreme case under the same principles

Hacking a semester.
•	Wharton has an auction system to pick classes – highest point bids win.  Most folks end up starting out with 5,000 points or so their first year; I ran some statistical analysis and traded classes to rack up around 15,000 points the first year, which allowed me to take whatever classes I wanted to take
•	Key point here is to understand that classes don’t make the class.  Professors make the class.  We have a few fantastic Professors here at Wharton (Adam Grant, Kartik Hosangar, etc.) – I would rather take basket weaving under their tutelage than take “how to make a billion dollars” under a really bad prof.  They key knowledge they impart is beyond technical – the most important knowledge they teach you are life lessons which are invaluable.  And in addition, as awesome professors, they help complement your professional network.  The students who are in their classes are usually really great students, for both recognizing great professorial talent and for figuring out a way to get in their class.  This hits upon 2 of our key goals of knowledge and relationships
•	The best thing about hacking classes with little responsibility and minimum course load is that it frees you up to informally take really valuable classes.  For example, I informally audit 1-3 classes every semester just to absorb the knowledge.  I’ve done that with computer programming and with classes like Enabling Technologies.  I basically figure out classes that have a high work load and large amounts of valuable knowledge and relationships and take those classes for no credit.  I get to know the prof by knowing materials and having better attendance than folks in the class; I absorb the knowledge from lectures but don’t do any time sucking midterms, finals or group projects.  It’s a great value proposition.

Hacking a class.  
•	This is relatively simple – it boils down to three things:
o	Know what counts for knowledge and grades in your class and optimize for those
o	Make sure you work with great people
o	Preview as much as you can
•	I use a similar system to hacking school and semester and apply it to class as well.  By picking only great classes, I make sure there’s valuable knowledge and great folks to meet.  I then read the syllabi and figure out what the key ingredients for a good grade are.  Is it heavily attendance based?  I show up regularly to those classes.  Is it based on one project?  Then the project is the thing I focus my time on.  Is it based on a midterm and final?  I’m judicious about skipping lectures and just cram before the exams.  This works out if you care about grades because it only focuses on what matters; sometimes classes just provide a structure and motivation for me to learn, but I find out a lot of formalities of classes (lectures, homework, etc.) are not always necessary
•	I found what’s also super helpful about classes is doing work ahead of time rather than doing work after the fact.  I.e. before my semester started in the fall, I did all the reading for all my classes in the fall semester.  Why?  Because (1) I know that knowing material beforehand allows me to absorb and learn better in lecture, making more efficient use of my lecture time which will (2) free up more of my time during the semester to work on startups.  I proceeded to spend 60-80 hours that week working on startups last semester while doing other things (comedy club, travel, date, etc.) and have since then.  

Conclusion
•	I hope these thoughts are helpful man.  I hope your key takeaway from this document was figuring out how to hack classes so you could spend the minimum time needed to graduate, learn real knowledge and build great relationships with your classmates and professors.  And I hope you feel this helps you get there in an unusually good way
•	What I found since graduating college is that the most valuable things I got from school was practical knowledge (i.e. how to build relationships, how to pitch, how to think through things like this hacking school protocol I came up with) and not academic knowledge (i.e. GDP =C+I+G+X-IM or something like that; I forget by now).  So for  me that involved starting companies both in undergrad and now in my MBA
•	Roughly though, this technique and thought process I laid out frees up your time to do whatever you want – and can be applied to working on startups, recruiting for jobs, dating, or playing video games/watching TV.  I wouldn’t waste such a valuable opportunity on the latter though ☺
