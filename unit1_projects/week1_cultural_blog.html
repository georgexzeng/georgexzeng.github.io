I loved the cultural blog video.  I love the fact that DBC was started out of this desire to help Shareem's friend learn how to be an awesome dev.  It's very much in line with the hacker mindset I have, and the kind of place I want to be a part of.  

<p>What was really surprising to me was the emphasis on soft skills in DBC.  My own experience with the world also is in line with the philosophy of DBC - IQ is just a very small piece of the world; it is the skills of working with other people that long-term has a more important impact on people's abilities to succed as either a software engineer or just a profesisonal in general.</p>
