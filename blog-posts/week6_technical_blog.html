Object Oriented Program vs Functional Programming

<p>I've always found the debate between object oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming (FP) to be fasicnating.  OOP represnets the concept of objects that have data fields and associated procedures known as objects.  Objects (as instances of classes) are used to interact with one another to design applications and programs.  FP, on the other hand, is about treating computer as teh evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids states and mutable data.  FP focuses on producing results that depend only on inputs and not on program state.  

At heart, it's always seemed to me that objected oriented programming has "won" programming mind share.  If you look at the main modern programming languages out there, they're basically all object oriented programming focused:</p>

<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Objective C</li>
<li>Javascript</li>

<p>Functional programming, on the other hand, seems to be a much more obscure, academic list of programming languages focused on mathematical applications.  Functional programming languages include:</p>

<li>Common Lisp</li>
<li>Scheme</li>
<li>Erlang</li>
<li>OCaml</li>
<li>R</li>
<li>Mathematica</li>

<p>There are clear pros and cons of each language though.  OOP means that modifying functions can involve annoying changes across many objects; similarly FP means that changing objects can involve making changes across many functions.  In addition, OOP emphasies state changes and order of execution whereas state changes and order of execution are less important in functional programming.  Although OOP is more intuitive (at least to me, representing the real world more realistically), functional programming does seem like it improves readability, maintability and makes debugging processes easier.</p>
