<p>Why is JavaScript popular in web development? What are the great things about JavaScript? What are it's limitations?</p>

<p>Javascript is fast becoming ver popular in web development given its ability to deliver rich, dynamic web content, its relatively lightweight nature, and the fact that it's pretty easy to use.  Javascript's key advantages are</p>

<ul>
	<li>De facto use in web applications already</li>
	<li>One language for client side and server side development</li>
	<li>Easy to learn nature</li>
	<li>Huge institutional support</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the most important reasons that javascript is becoming so popular is that it's already one of the de facto languages used for front end web development right now.  In addition to HTML and CSS, Javascript is already being used and is familiar to many developers.</p>

<p>Given that developers are already familiar with javascript on the front end, it makes intuitive sense to also use javascript for the backend, so you have one langauge that's able to suport development across both front end and back end parts of an application.</p>

<p>Javascript is easy to learn - it's a language taught in many high school programming classes, and it's a natural transition for programmerns who've studied java or C in the past.</p>

<p>Lastly, Javascript has been given a huge amount of institutional support.  Google has taken javascript very seriouslay and has started a performance war in browsers that now manys many very advanced web apps can be built using javascript.  Node.js has made building javascript applications easier.  Angular.js has also resulted in many improvements int he capability of javascript.</p>

<p>Javascript's main limitations seem to be around security and maturity - but honestly, I'm beginning to feel that javascript may be the "language of the future," and have often wondered why Developer Bootcamp doesn't switch away from Ruby and into javascript/node/angular entirely.</p>
