<p>Writing questions that people will answer is important for our own learning.  At heart, writing a question that people will answer has a logical component but also an emotional component.</p>
<p>Writing a good question logically is actually the easier step.  It boils down to 
<li>writing a title that summarizes your specific problem, so others know what you're writing about before they open your post</li>
<li>introduce the problem before you post any code so people will know exactly what your main problems are</li>
<li>help others reproduce the problem you're facing, so they can see for themselves what your problems are</li>
<li>tag appropriately so it's easy to find and identify the category of problems you're dealing with</li>
<li>proofread before you post so your question is presented in a crisp and coherent manner</li></p>
<p>However, beyond logically laying out your question, there's also an emotional psychological aspect of posting good questions.  Those include:
<li>making sure your question is thoughtful and well researched.  no one wants to answer a question that could have been answered with a little Googlin, thinking or has already been answered many times before</li>
<li>make sure you engage and provide feedback to answers or comments on your question.  if peole are taking the time to respond to your question, it's only fair if you respond back</li>
<li>make sure you build a personal relationship with different folks in the community.  at the end of the day, a community is built up of people.  those people are much more likely to answer your questions or help out if you have a relationship/friendship with them</li></p>
