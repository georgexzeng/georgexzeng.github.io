<p>One of the things I'm conscious of as a tech entrepreneur is, is there a buble in tech right now?  And what are the implications of that for developers and people working in tech?</p>
<p>People have debated the question back and forth; from a financial side, it seems that we are not quite in a bubble yet.  Fred Wilson has written on this question, and one of the most insight points he brought up is that the reason valuations are so high are because interest rates are so low (http://avc.com/2014/03/the-bubble-question/).</p>
<p>That rings true from a financial side, but from an entrepreneur's side - it feels like there's a bubble happening.  There's an influx of entrepreneurs and a lot of money chasing those entrepreneurs.  It's never been easier to start businesses or to raise money than in the current environment.  This may usher in an era of productivity and innovation in the US economy, but this may come at the expense of entrepreneurs and developers working for this ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, I believe that although we may be in a bubble, that question is largely moot from a practical perspective for developers and tech workers.  There's a really great book discussing this, called "Average is Over" - http://www.amazon.com/Average-Is-Over-Powering-Stagnation/dp/0525953736.  The crux of the book is that in the future, society will be changing to an economy that is split between people who will be either using technology to disrupt industries or be on the disrupting side of industries that are being replaced by technology.  I believe that we're building the key skills that are going to be relevant no matter what we do in the future - and that's something worth investing in right now.</p>
