Static vs relative vs absolute vs fixed positioning

<p>There are many types of positioning systems one can use - and they can be utilized to really add standout content to a website or blog.  The main choices we have are

<li>Static positioning</li>
<li>Relative positioning</li>
<li>Absolute positioning</li>
<li>Fixed positioning</li></p>

<p>Static positioning is boring - it's exaclty what you would think.  It's the default positioning of content on a website that comes as if you didn't have any kind of styling added to it.  The only reason you would actually set an element to static is to remove some positioning that was outside your control.</p>

<p>Relative positioning is a bit of a misnomer.  Setting an element to <i>position: relative;</i> on an element with no other positioning attributes doesn't affect its position (it will be static) - but establish that element as a base by which other elements can be positioned.  However, if you do give it some positioning attribute (like for example <i>top: 10px;</i>) it will shift its position 10 pixels down from where it would normally be.  It's often used to line up form elements.  Setting a relative position does two toher things:

<li>it introduces the ability to use z-index on that element, which doesn't really work with statically positioned elements.  This element will now appear on top of any other statically positioned eelments</li>
<li>It also limits the scope of aboslutely positioned child elements.  Any element that's a child of that relatively positioned element can be absolutely positioned within that block</li></p>

<p>Absolute positioning is something I"m on the fence about.  It allows you to literally place any page element somewhere specifically on a page.  These values are relative to the next parent element with relative (or absolute) positioning.  You can use positioning attributes of top, right, bottom, left to set the location.  These positionings are all relative to the next parent element - if there's no parent, it'll default all the way back up to the html element itself, meaning it'll be placed relative to the page itself.  Absolute elements are removed from the flow of elements on the page.</p>

<p>Last but not least, there is fixed positioning.  A fixed positioning is positioned relative to the viewport - or the browser window itself.  Viewport doesn't change when the window is scrolled - so a fixed positioned element will stay right where it is when the page is scrolled, where a sidebar or a piece of the page is fixed.  It keeps the navigation present at all times and creates an interesting effect on the page.  The bad is that it creates useability and responsiveness issues.  Can also overlap footer content.  Cool effect but an effect that has to be used with caution.</p>
