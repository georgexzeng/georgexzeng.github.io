<p>Although I find psychological tests very interesting, I find it harder to find ways to apply these results into my everyday life.</p>

<p>Abstract sequential method of thinking has been mariginally helpful to me in understanding my own thinking.  Although I agree with it, I struggle with the implications of this categorization.  I tend to think in ideas.  I tend to think in logcial steps.  Websites online tell me that I work best when I</p>

<ul>
	<li>have reading references and expert sources</li>
	<li>are sure of themselves</li>
	<li>follow traditional procedures</li>
	<li>have time to learn material throughly</li>
	<li>work alone</li>
	<li>am respected fo rintellectual ability</li>
	<li>ask why is this?</li>
	<li>write analytical eassys</li>
	<li>rely on lecture notes adn written materials</li>
	<li>do library research</li>
</ul>

<p>My learning preferences are Aural, Reading and Kinesthetic.  My biggest takeaways here are that because I score high in three categories, I should supplement my learning in a multi-modal way - i.e. vary the ways I take in information.</p>

<p>Although I agree with just a subpart of this, I plan on applying these realizations to DBC in a few very specific ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I plan on utilizing video/lectures (Aural), reading of books and documentation (Reading) and kinesthetic (actually coding) in equal parts in my learning</li>
	<li>I plan on doing lots of fundamental reading and thinking to understand the core concepts in a deep way</li>
	<li>I want to supplement this by lectures and videos</li>
	<li>And I want to reinfoce this with short coding exercises while learning, and bigger projects when I'm not learning key core concepts</li>
