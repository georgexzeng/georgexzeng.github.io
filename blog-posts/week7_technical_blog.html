SQL vs NoSQL

<p>There's been a debate evolving between SQL and NoSQL.  At its core, SQL gives a way fro relational databases to store data and communicate.  NoSQL refers to a newer type of non-relational databases that uses keys or documents to store data that is starting to gain more popularity in certain circles.</p>
<p>The first reason some circles are starting to favor NoSQL has to do with performance.  The relationship and tables that make up SQL databases can, for really large organizations, number in the millions.  If you have millions of users doing lookups in these tables, you can have major performance issues in the system.</p>
<p>The second reason some circles are starting to favor NoSQL has to do with structure.  Large scale programming projects using complex data and hierachies (such as XML) are difficult to incorporate into SQL.   These data types, which can contain objects, lists and other data types don't map well to tables consisting only of rows and columns.  SQL databases require having established schemas upfront, which can become difficult to change later on.  NoSQL databases don't have that limitation.</p>
<p>Lastly, proponents of NoSQL advocate that it's easier to scale horizontally by adding more servers for NoSQL - whereas the same task is much more difficult for SQL servers.</p>
<p>Despite this though, SQL databases like MySQL, Oracle, etc. are still very popluar.  This has to do with the fact that the standards for SQL are much better defined, mature, understood and will definitively be around in the future.  NoSQL has many advantages, but it's probably better applied in limited circumstances and as technologies mature.</p>
