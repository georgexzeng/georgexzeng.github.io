<p>I found this week's stereotype threat article to be fascinating.  As a person of Asian background, I find that people automatically have certain stereotypes (both positive and negative) that may or may not.  As an Asian glasses wearing male, immediate stereotypes include

<li>I'm good at math and science</li>
<li>I have poor social skills</li>
<li>I'm bad at sports</li>


<p>The actual answers are, as expected much more nuanced.  I'm good at analytical tasks (math and philosophy), creative pursuits (music, poetry, writing) but bad at memorization (organic chemistry or anything that involves large amounts of memorization).  I'm a very extroverted person; but find I have to overcome initial stereotypes people have against Asian guys before that's accepted.  I'm good at certain sports (running, soccer and weigh lifting) but poor at others (basketball, baseball, etc.).</p>

<p>However, I found some of my own fundamental beliefs to be challenged.  For example, I believe strongly in the idea of meritocracy - and am against preferential treatment to any groups based on race (I can sympathize with socioeconomic status a lot more).  The argument goes that why give racial preference for college admissions for a black son of a CEO versus the white son of a garbage collector?  It seems like race is often used as an overly generalized proxy for socioeconomics, when we can just use economics directly.</p>

<p>I was surprised to understand that there may be a stereotype threat where people have the equivalent of racial pressure to conform one way or another.  That's actually disturbing to me - it makes me wonder at the prospect of self fulfilling expectations for black students, as well as consider there may be self fulfilling positive expectations for Asian students to succed in academics.  Unfortunately, I still don't know what to make of all this.  I'm questioning some of my original beliefts and accepting they may be wrong - and going forward will make a strong effort to make sure I don't implement stereotype threats to any groups.</p>
