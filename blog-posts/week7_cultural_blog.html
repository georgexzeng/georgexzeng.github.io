<p>If I take a look at the long list of attributes in values, the ones that were present when I was happiest and produest are the following:</p>

<li>accomplishment</li>
<li>achievement</li>
<li>ambition</li>
<li>close relationships</li>
<li>creativity</li>
<li>excitement</li>
<li>growth</li>
<li>meaningful work</li>
<li>mentorship</li>
<li>power and authority</li>
<li>self-knowledge</li>

<p>This is a long list and it's a long list for a reason.  I realize that what motivates me isn't money - it's accomplishing great, exciting things with great people.  It's growing during that process - by working on new things, through great mentors, and also being a great mentor. </p>

<p>In general I live up to these values - a definite 5/5.</p>

<p>Someone just asked me for advice on startup related career choices.</p>

<p>Yes - I believe I can help mediate stereotype threat when I see it, but I haven't recognized it in the past.  If the stereotype threat is mostly internal, I'm not 100% sure what the best way to help with this process.</p>
