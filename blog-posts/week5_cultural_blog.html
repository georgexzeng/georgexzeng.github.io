<p><b>Pairing:</b></p>

<p>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</p>
<p>Frankly pairing with other people to solve challenges is fun! It offers a 
way of swapping tips and tricks while enjoying another person's company
and also swapping war stories.</p>

<p>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</p>
<p>Getting to know my cohort mates better, swapping specific tips and tricks, and just hanging out was very fun.</p>

<p>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</p>
<p>Nothing particularly frustrating or difficult so far about pairing.</p>

<p><b>Feedback</b></p>

<p>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</p>
<p>Overall, I felt the feedback was positive.  Unfortunately, I didn't
take as many actionable changes to implement.</p>

<p>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</p>
<p>No</p>

<p>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</p>
<p>Have more of a game plan on what to do, before going in</p>

<p>How was it to write feedback?</p>
<p>Difficult - most of the folks I've paired with have been really great; there's not much actionable advice I can offer them.</p>

<p>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</p>
<p>The folks I've worked with have been working hard; the only actionable
general piece of advice I can give them is work harder to become more familiar
with Ruby/HTML/CSS/Javascript.  However, I know they're already working very
hard so I'm not sure how helpful that feedback is.</p>

<p>Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?</p>
<p>Overall, pairing has been amazingly helpful; although the feedback process
has not been as helpful thus far.</p>
