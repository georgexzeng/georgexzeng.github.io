<p>Regular expressions or regexes are a sequence of characters that form a search pattern - its principle uses boil down to testing, extracting and changing of text.</p>
<p>Regexes in ruby is especially interesting.  Using regexes in Ruby is akin to a sub-programming language within the large Ruby language.  Given that everything is an object in Ruby, regexes are also objects.  Since you can send messages to objects, you can also send messages to regular expressions.  You can assign them to variables, pass methods to them and more.  Using regexes and Ruby together, one can use very powerful applications of testing, extracting and changing of different strings in Ruby.</p>
<p>Some of the most common ways of using regexes in Ruby include: basic matching, lookarounds (define a context for a match using Ruby's scan method), lookaheads(matching ahead in data) and lookbehinds (matching behind in data).</p>
<p>Some of the most immediate applications of regexes in Ruby include:</p>
<li>data cleaning</li>
<li>finding different strings in long unstructured text</li>
<li>changing formatting of different text</li>
<li>ordering or sorting dates</li>
<li>converting data formats</li>
<li>switching visulalizations</li>
<li>cleaning up OCR</li>
<p>All in all, regexes are incredibly powerful - and a subprogramming language worthy of learning!</p></div>
